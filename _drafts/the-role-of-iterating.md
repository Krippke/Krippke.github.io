Tell the story of how you started developing and how the first few projects went.
Focus on the time it took to get the first insights into the problem domain and how this affected the schedule.

Tell what you tried to do to improve your performance. The first attempt was to define everything in detail in advance. But this led to minimal success. The change came when you realised that you can't define everything in advance. You have to start with the project, with a rough framework of the problem domain. The insights come along the way.

As we tried to iterate faster, the way we optimised changed. The focus was on identifying what was taking time during an iteration and working on those items to reduce iteration time.

Changes made - goals:

- A local development environment must be available by running a command.
- Communication with other systems must be verifiable by a single command.
- A new project member must receive all project-related information in the project's `doc/` folder.
